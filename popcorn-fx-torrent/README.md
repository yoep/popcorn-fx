# FX-Torrent

FX-Torrent is the most complete BitTorrent implementation fully written in Rust, which supports both Linux, MacOS and Windows. 
It supports most of the Bittorrent protocol specification such as multi-file torrents, validating existing files, resuming torrent files, 
and is based on the `libtorrent` library for functionality and naming convention.

## Installation

To install the library, add the following cargo dependency.

```toml
[dependencies]
popcorn-fx-torrent = { path = "../popcorn-fx-torrent" }
```

## Usage

Every interaction with `Torrent`, `Tracker` or `Peer`, requires the use of a `Session` which isolates torrents from each other.
It is however possible to interact with `.torrent` metadata through the `TorrentInfo` without making use of any `Session`.

_Create a new session_
```rust
use popcorn_fx_torrents::torrents::{FxTorrentSession, Session};

// The fx-torrent crate makes use of async tokio runtimes
// this requires that new sessions and torrents need to be created within an async context
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
  let session: Session = FxTorrentSession::builder()
    .base_path("/torrent/location/directory")
    .client_name("MyClient")
    .build();
}
```
