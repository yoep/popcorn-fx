Popcorn FX was based on the original Popcorn Desktop and Popcorn Android versions. Popcorn FX uses **OpenJFX** as UI and **Rust**
as backend. This version was created to work with embedded devices such as the Raspberry PI, but it also works
on desktop environments such as **Linux, Windows & Mac**.

Popcorn FX has been tested with **Raspberry Pi 3B+ and 4**.
